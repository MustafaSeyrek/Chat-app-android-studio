# Chat-app-android-studio
The chat app I implemented by following the tutorial on Udemy. Data was kept with Firebase real-time database. What I did in addition to the course: Message deletion, user-friendly interface design, encrypted storage of messages in the database and decryption of messages while they are presented to the user.
